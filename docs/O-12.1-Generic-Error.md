1. ### **Cause**
There are many possible causes to this particular type of error, among which the most common ones are:

- If it is a request to the web method GetStatusByTimeSpan, the provided dates are not in correct format.
- Either username token or password token in the request header is not correct.
- The element wsu:Created has expired. It must be re-generated at the time before the request is sent. A large delay would cause Omaha API to consider the provided wsu:Created expired. 
  1. ### **Actions**
1. Double-check username and password
1. Log a request for issue investigation to Fiserv. The request must detail:
- When the SOAP request was submitted
- The submitting username
