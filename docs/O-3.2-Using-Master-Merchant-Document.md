# **3.2 USING MASTER MAPPING DOCUMENT**

The master mapping document for Omaha API is very useful in that it contains a lot of information that can be used to manipulate and control the input XMLs more effectively.

The most basic information you can obtain from the document includes:

- XML Path: The parent XML tag representing MPA section
- XML Field: The XML tag representing the MPA input field within the MPA section
- Type: Input type of the MPA input field
- Length/Range: Maximum allowed length of the MPA input field/Minimum value – Maximum value of the MPA input field
- Required: Is the MPA input field mandatory?
- Enumeration Values: Selectable values in case the input type of the MPA input field is “Select List”

Note: You must make sure the Omaha API master mapping is up-to-date with the Omaha Boarding API tool.
