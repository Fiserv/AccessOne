   1. ### **Common issue #1: Generic Error**
      1. #### **Indicator**

|<p><s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"></p><p>`  `<s:Body></p><p>`    `<s:Fault></p><p>`      `<faultcode>s:Client</faultcode></p><p>`      `<faultstring xml:lang="en-US">Generic error occurred.</faultstring></p><p>`    `</s:Fault></p><p>`  `</s:Body></p><p></s:Envelope></p>|

1. #### **Cause**
There are many possible causes to this particular type of error, among which the most common ones are:

- If it is a request to the web method GetStatusByTimeSpan, the provided dates are not in correct format.
- Either username token or password token in the request header is not correct.
- The element wsu:Created has expired. It must be re-generated at the time before the request is sent. A large delay would cause North FACS API to consider the provided wsu:Created expired. 
  1. #### **Actions**
1. Double-check username and password
1. Log a request for issue investigation to First Data. The request must detail:
- When the SOAP request was submitted
- The submitting username

1. #### **Cause**
North Boarding  API was implemented with numerous validation rules to prevent false MPA data from being entered into the First Data system. 
1. #### **Actions**
If you are not aware of the existence of the validation rule or the error message(s) returned are not informative enough, please contact First Data for further support.

The support request must provide the following information:

- The username the MPA was submitted with
- The XML content of the MPA
  1. ### **Common issue #3: Submission failure without specific errors** 
     1. #### **Indicator**
A response comparable to the one in the screenshot below is returned by North FACS API. More details are available in [North FACS Boarding API - Basic Verification Guide.](#_Basic_Verification_Guides) 

|<p><SubmitMPAResult xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"></p><p>`  `<ExternalRefId xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">0000001</ExternalRefId></p><p>`  `<Timestamp xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">02/16/2016 05:19:12 PM</Timestamp></p><p>`  `<Status xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">FAILURE</Status></p><p>`  `<Errors xmlns="http://tempuri.org/" /></p><p></SubmitMPAResult></p>|

1. #### **Cause**
As there should have been a clear error message indicating which validation rule was violated that led to the submission failure, this is likely an unknown defect of North Boarding FACS API. 
1. #### **Actions**
Send a support request to First Data with information about:

- The username the MPA was submitted with
- The XML content of the MPA
