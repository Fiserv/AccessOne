# **4.1 Soap UI Project**

This section specifies the detailed requirements for applying WS-Security Authentication using Username Tokens with a Username and Password Digest. The OASIS standard is being utilized with the profile of Web Services Security Username Token Profile Version 1.1.1.

The following request sample illustrates how the security information will be sent within SOAP Header. Note that the SOAP body will vary depending on the specifics of the data communicated by Lonestar pillars.

The following namespaces are used: http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd and http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd which are represented below by the prefixes “wsu” and “wsse” respectively.
The entry-point to WS-Security is a SOAP Header element called <wsse:Security>. It contains the security-related data and information. Within <wsse:Security>, the following elements are required (Note that the order of the elements below is fixed for security purposes):
<wsu:Timestamp>: It is used to express the creation and expiration time of the message. To address replay attacks, the message timestamps are required:
-	<wsu:Created>: the creation time of the message.
-	<wsu:Expires>: the expiration time of the message.
<wsse:UsernameToken>: the Username, PasswordDigest and the security-related information to authenticate the identity will be provided within this element:
-	<wsse:Username>: the clear text username. 
-	<wsse:Password>: it holds the digested password which is constructed as follows:

PasswordDigest = Base64( SHA-1( nonce + created + password-token) )

That is, concatenate the nonce, creation timestamp, and the password-token, digest the combination using SHA-1 hash algorithm, then include the Base64 coding of that result as the password.

Note that depending on the specifics of the API, there would be a single username/password-token to consume the service or multiple usernames/password-tokens based on the Portfolio Manager User Setup.

-	<wsse:Nonce>: a cryptographically random value. Each message must include a new nonce value to detect replay attacks.
o	“Nonce”: is the clear text value that generated by sender. However, when it’s sent in header of SOAP request, it must be encoded to a base64 string
-	<wsu:Created>: the creation time of the message.
Sample code using Nonce and Create to compute the PasswordDigest:
var nonce = "MTQ1Mjc4MzQzOTE0Mw=="; //nlapiEncrypt(date.getTime().toString(), 'base64'); // ex: "1453220513715" --> "MTQ1MzIyMDUxMzcxNQ=="
            var nonceText = atob(nonce);

            var created = "2016-01-14T10:15:19.143Z";//date.toISOString(); // ex: "2016-01-19T16:21:53.715Z"
            var pwToken = 'S7O0g2w7Q9';
            var innerPass = nonceText + created + pwToken; // ex: "MTQ1MzIyMDUxMzcxNQ==2016-01-19T16:21:53.715ZS7O0g2w7Q9"
            var passwordDigest = CryptoJS.SHA1(innerPass).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
            var passwordDigestCorrect = CryptoJS.SHA1(nonceText + created + pwToken).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

Follow the below instructions to import the sample project which will enable you to be able to test your connection:

- Import the sample project
  - PLACEHOLDER FOR SOAP UI TEMPLATE
- Save the SOAP Project to your local computer
- Open SoapUI 5.2.0
- File>Import Project (Ctrl-l) to import the SOAP Project

- You will see the project on the navigation panel on the left once the import is finished. Click the + sign to display the web methods. There should be 3 as in the following image.

- Expand SubmitMPA and double-click on Request1 to open its interface. Before sending a SOAP request, make sure to apply the web service security configurations by right-clicking > Apply outgoing WSS as in the following image
- Make sure the URL points to [https://lsuat-api.fdportfoliomanager.com/boarding/omaha/AsBoardingAPIService.svc](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__lsuat-2Dapi.fdportfoliomanager.com_boarding_omaha_AsBoardingAPIService.svc&d=BQMFAw&c=ewHkv9vLloTwhsKn5d4bTdoqsmBfyfooQX5O7EQLv5TtBZ1CwcvjU063xndfqI8U&r=qOFmeH8jp_d2xkmDNk5tp2P1JYFaGjN1XetZ9DOsV9U&m=Kaq4OGl_ACgHo5zDqlMuQyaaWCb7LI5_04tXjkt0vZ4&s=ghWtxN462cQOmRLC11Xak8Su2hvUR30HYfLSq-SHYnI&e=)  for Omaha WS in UAT

- Click on the green arrow to send the request


- Expand to display the web method RetrieveMPAXML. Repeat 5 and 6 to verify RetrieveMPAXML. Note that MPA ID must be supplied, referenced from the result of step 6 above to make the retrieval request valid.

- ` `Make sure the URL points to [https://lsuat-api.fdportfoliomanager.com/boarding/omaha/AsBoardingAPIService.svc](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__lsuat-2Dapi.fdportfoliomanager.com_boarding_omaha_AsBoardingAPIService.svc&d=BQMFAw&c=ewHkv9vLloTwhsKn5d4bTdoqsmBfyfooQX5O7EQLv5TtBZ1CwcvjU063xndfqI8U&r=qOFmeH8jp_d2xkmDNk5tp2P1JYFaGjN1XetZ9DOsV9U&m=Kaq4OGl_ACgHo5zDqlMuQyaaWCb7LI5_04tXjkt0vZ4&s=ghWtxN462cQOmRLC11Xak8Su2hvUR30HYfLSq-SHYnI&e=)  for Omaha WS in UAT

- Click on the green arrow to send the request


**Note:** 

- Rather than using this sample project, users can create an entirely new project from scratch by entering the correct URL and configuring a WSS based on provided user account(s). 
- WSS must be re-applied every time before a request is sent to Omaha API WS. 


Note:  It is recommended that if you are using a different interface than Soap UI to send the web service calls that you work within Soap UI first to ensure that your submissions are making it to FD successfully.  Once you have this piece working, you can then port the information over to the interface that you will be using.
