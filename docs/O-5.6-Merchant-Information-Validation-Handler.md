The validation handler will conduct two steps of validation against the Merchant Information details. The following descriptions show how these steps function.

**Schema Validation**

This is the first step of validation to ensure the received XML content has well-formed structure and valid enumerations that conform to the enumeration definition in the XML schema. If it successfully passes the schema validation, the following steps will be conducted. Otherwise, the error message will show specifically to every violation against the schema definition.
