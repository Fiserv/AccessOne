# **9.0 CONNECTIVITY VERIFICATION VIA AN EXTERNAL TOOL**

As it is understood that web service calls actually are made from outside of the SOAP UI tool, once the connectivity testing with the SOAP UI tool is completed, one can go ahead with verifying the Omaha Boarding SOAP API using another internal tool other than the SOAP UI one. 

Fiserv must be informed of the result of connectivity tests with Omaha Boarding API using the SOAP UI tool. This will help Fiserv stay up-to-date with the latest progress of partners and will also expedite the troubleshooting/support process in case there is any technical difficulty or issue involved. 

This section provides additional information about how SOAP requests to Omaha Boarding API should be constructed with an aim to assist with the generation of valid SOAP requests from Fiserv partners.   

Omaha Boarding SOAP API was designed to understand many different formats of SOAP requests. However to be considered valid by the web service, SOAP requests must meet defined minimum structural requirements to guarantee a successful integration with Omaha Boarding SOAP API. More details are available in:

- Section 1: SOAP request header
- Section 2: SOAP request body
