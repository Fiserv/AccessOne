# Merchant Inquiry

Real-time inquiry APIs will retrieve merchant attribute information directly against the backend systems of record.  The APIs use a full REST/JSON implementation and all of the associated documentation is included directly in the API specifications.  An API is available to retrieve all merchant attributes.  There are also APIs to retrieve smaller subset of information (e.g. Location Chaining, Merchant Profile, Programs, Entitlements, Billing Attributes).
