# **3.5 BOARDING PROCESS**

Once the MPAs have been successfully submitted through Boarding API, they will be processed as standard MPAs in Boarding system. These MPAs are regarded as complete in keying under the user account whose credentials have been passed along with the MPA XML Content. They will be then transmitted to UAL after being approved in the Client Approval process.

During keying, Client Approval, Transmission and UAL Boarding processes, it is the Fiserv Boarding system’s responsibility to track and update the MPA status.

For managing and reporting purposes, these MPAs will be permanently set with the MPA Type of “API” to distinguish them from the Standard MPAs created from the UI. This will not allowed the users to change the MPA Type. The users, however, are still able to edit other MPA data where applicable.
