Since every status attribute has multiple status values, it will be reported multiple times based on the status value updates. The status attributes which have the Report Level = “MPA” will be reported on the first Location only, the others which have the Report Level = “Location” will be reported on any Locations that have the status updates. 

The status attributes table above contains all possible status attributes with status values. However, reporting the status will totally depend on the MPA Type and the MPA data. The following cases will explain how reporting status varies by MPA:

- Based on the MPA data, some of the status attributes may not be reported. For example, in an MPA, if the Equipment Front End has not been set up for say Location #2, then Location #2 will not have any of the Front End Statuses reported such as LocationEquipment, LocationNashville, LocationDatawire, LocationFEOmaha, LocationFECardnet, LocationClover, LocationRapidConnect.
- The status attributes which relate to Merchant Approval process such as Merchant2Approval, Merchant1Approval, MerchantChangeApproval will not be reported for the MPAs submitted via the API because all of them are Standard MPAs which do not require Merchant Approval. These are identified for future use.
